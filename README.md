# 🤖 Project Overview: AI Chatbot with NLP using Python
🎯 Objective:

To build a basic AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK or spaCy, capable of understanding user inputs and responding to simple queries intelligently.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python Libraries: NLTK – for tokenization, lemmatization, and text preprocessing random – for generating varied responses

🧠 Features:

Understands basic user intents like: Greetings (Hi, Hello) Gratitude (Thanks) Farewell (Bye) Identity queries (Who are you?) Uses lemmatization and tokenization to process user input Responds appropriately based on detected intent Simple to run from terminal or integrate into a larger interface

📌 Learning Outcomes:

Hands-on experience with NLP in Python Implementing a rule-based chatbot from scratch Understanding of text preprocessing, intent detection, and response generation Lays the groundwork for more advanced chatbot development (e.g., with machine learning or APIs)
